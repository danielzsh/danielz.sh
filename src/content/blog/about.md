This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), a beautiful framework you should definitely try out; I also used a bit of [React](https://react.dev) and [swiper.js](https://swiperjs.com) to make the cards on the homepage. Here's the [source code](https://github.com/danielzsh/danielz.sh) in case you're interested!

## Some Design Inspiration

- https://vercel.com (for links)
- https://antfu.me (just for being a really cool website)
- [Next.js template](https://nextjs-template.vercel.app/) (for the card component)
- [GitHub Blog](https://github.blog) (for the blog layout)
