# I'm Daniel!
For everyone who's seen my old website, I apologize dearly. Anyway, here's some stuff about me!

## Projects
Here are some of my projects, in roughly chronological order.

### `spark` (2020-2021)
`spark` was my first truly ambitious project; I was bored during COVID and was curious how programming languages worked, so I did some digging and found Ruslan Spivak's amazing [Let's Build a Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) series. Following the tutorial in C++ rather than Python and switching up the features and syntax, I ended up with `spark`. Try it out for yourself [here](https://github.com/danielzsh/spark)!

### `blocks` (2021-2022)
If you do any kind of programming, I'm sure you've heard of Scratch, the infamous block programming language. Take a wild guess as to what [`blocks`](https://danielzsh.github.io/blocks/#/) is (be patient; the page may take a while to load)!

### `usaco.guide` (2023-present)
If you haven't checked out the [usaco.guide](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide) before, please do! Here's some of what I contributed, in no particular order:
- GitHub integration with the usaco.guide editor [(PR here)](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/pull/4197)
- [Self-updating repo](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-problems) of USACO problems
- Metadata parser from problem url [(PR here)](https://github.com/cpinitiative/usaco-guide/pull/4251)

*the parser in all its glory*

I also contributed some content, but it's not particularly noteworthy.

...and there's not much else :)
